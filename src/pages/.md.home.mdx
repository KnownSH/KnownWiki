# KnownWiki
<Home />

**KnownWiki** is a fast web-based personal wiki platform created and primarily maintained by [KnownSH](/knownsh), it is visually based off of MediaWiki although does not use any code from it.
The website is built to be easy to maintain and modify, with most pages being statically generated ahead of time.
KnownWiki is hosted on the domain `knownsh.cc` and utilizes Vercel's server infrastructure for its hosting.

KnownWiki articles are written in English, other languages will be supported when KnownSH learns them. This site is for fun, and is not hosted for profit.

## History
### knownsh.cc-blog
Before KnownWiki, the knownsh.cc domain hosted a personal website. 
This earlier website had a simple, dark-themed design and served as a portfolio and personal introduction page. It was created with the Zola static site framework, this framework would eventually be the reason for the development of KnownWiki.
