# The Writing Styles of KnownSH
I use several different writing styles throughout this entire wiki. This article explains the context behind my writing decisions. 
I want to make it clear that I have no interest in taking a creative writing course (or any English language-related course). 
In fact, despite English being my native language, I am aware that [my grammar](#grammar) is still not up to the standard you see on most websites. 
**If you notice anything that could be phrased more effectively, please let me know.**

## Grammar
This one is nice and short:
- Yes, I do use grammar checkers.<sup>[[a lot]]()</sup>
  - I won't use GPT's to expand stuff though.

- Yes, I do write very strange sentences sometimes, and no, most of the time i'm not the one to catch it.
- My mind thinks a million kilometers per hour, i'll miss a word or two there (mutuals will know how much I edit messages).
### List of KnownSH writing blunders
<sup>if this one gets very long i'll make an article for it</sup>
- "is" instead of "if"
  - *"is this one gets very long i'll make an article for it"*

## Some topics I refuse to write about
- Politics (Some exceptions)
- Drama
- Fictional stories based around love or relationships

## First-person Writing
Many of the articles (or even sections of articles) on [KnownWiki](/home) are written from a first-person perspective. 
There will be notices for wherever this occurs *(at the top of this page for instance)*. There are a few different reasons for why I write this way:
- Some of the content on the wiki is very personal, and that sometimes makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. 
  This especially occurs when I try to write about myself from a third-person perspective.
- Using a more casual writing style often leads to articles that are easier to read and more relatable, 
  and sets a tone that the article isn't really meant to be taken seriously (in an *"encylopedic"* sense). 
- By writing from the first-person, it helps to keep things conversational, which makes complex topics more accessible, possibly understandable and engaging.
