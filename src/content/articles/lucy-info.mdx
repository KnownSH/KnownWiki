# Lucy
<KHTML/>
**Lucy** is a anthropomorphic squirrel-humanoid [OC]() belonging to [PinPin](https://x.com/PinMyPinXN)

They were created spontanously after a series of jokes due to the creator, [PinPin](https://x.com/PinMyPinXN), having a [Roblox](https://roblox.com/) avatar at one point which included a disproportionally large *cat tail*. A friend joked that the tail ressembled one of a squirrel's, and as such, **Lucy** was born.

<br/>

## Personality & Relationships
**Lucy** is a shy, reserved person, whose character has changed little both in her characterization and physical appearence. She's often fearful to act upon things, often needing outside help to do so, usually by force or by warning.

She's known to be resentful of overly revealing clothing, to the point some close to her have reported her having a wardrobe that *"resembles someone who lives eternally in a winter climate"*

As of now, she lives with her parents, and is entering her final year of high school.

They have a current, informal relationship with [Dovey](https://x.com/missdoveyx)<sup>[[OC]](https://toyhou.se/19825625.angel-sona)</sup>.
